**Zhiyuan Peng (彭志远)** is the first-year Ph.D. student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Yuan Luo.

My research interest includes **Large Language Model, Software Testing, and Software Security**. I have published papers at the top international conferences such as **FSE/ISSTA/ICSE/CVPR**. I developed a few well-known approaches including:
- [SVulD](https://github.com/vinci-grape/SVulD) and [MVulD](https://github.com/vinci-grape/MVulD): Vulnerability Detection
- [CodeGPTSensor+](https://github.com/vinci-grape/CodeGPTSensor-plus): LLM-generated Code Detection
- [ThinkRepair](https://github.com/vinci-grape/ThinkRepair): Program Repair
- [Rectifier](https://github.com/vinci-grape/Rectifier): Code Translation
- [AUGER](https://github.com/vinci-grape/AUGER) and [RATester](): Unit Test Generation
